# Golang Snippets

Here are some Go code snippets that I wrote, which are classic, general usage, or explanatory.
## Installation

```bash
$ go get -d github.com/xvrzhao/golang-snippets
```

## Run Examples

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/gtihub.com/xvrzhao/golang-snippets

$ go run main.go
```

Edit the code within function `man` in `main.go` file to run the examples you want to run.
